# Make Change Project -SD Week 1 Project

### Description
Create a program that takes in user input for payment of an item and returns correct change, along with the denominations given back. Mostly if then and else statements. 

### Lessons Learned
I learned how to use DecimalFormat utility to make the math.random generator give
and appropriate monetary output. Ultimately it did not work because the stored value was not actually two decimal places, so the math didn't work. I chose to change from the df utility and truncate the Double value into a float instead.
